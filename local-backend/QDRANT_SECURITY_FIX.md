# Qdrant Security Fix

## Security Vulnerability

**CRITICAL**: The original MCP Qdrant server had a security vulnerability where `qdrant-find` operations returned documents from ALL users, not just the current user. This allowed users to access files uploaded by other users.

## Problem Details

1. **Storage**: Documents were correctly stored WITH `user_id` in metadata
2. **Search**: The `qdrant-find` operation searched ALL documents without user filtering
3. **Impact**: Users could access documents from other users - major privacy breach

## Solution

We implemented a **monkey patch** for the MCP Qdrant server that:

1. **Patches the search method** in `QdrantConnector` to add user filtering
2. **Adds mandatory user_id filtering** to all search operations
3. **Fails securely** if user context cannot be determined
4. **Adds necessary indexes** for efficient filtering

## Files Modified

### 1. Main Patch File
- `local-backend/mcp_local/qdrant_user_filter_patch.py`
  - Contains the monkey patch for `QdrantConnector.search`
  - Adds user filtering to prevent cross-user access
  - Gets user context from LocalUserStore or MCP agent context

### 2. Application Startup
- `local-backend/main.py`
  - Applies security patches during startup
  - Logs prominent warnings if patches fail

### 3. Database Setup
- `backend/scripts/setup_qdrant.py`
  - Updated to create `user_id` and `file_id` indexes for new collections

### 4. Index Migration Script
- `local-backend/scripts/add_user_index_to_qdrant.py`
  - Adds missing indexes to existing collections
  - Verifies data integrity

## How the Fix Works

### Before (Vulnerable)
```python
# Original search - NO USER FILTERING
search_results = await self._client.query_points(
    collection_name=collection_name,
    query=query_vector,
    using=vector_name,
    limit=limit,
    # No filter = returns ALL documents!
)
```

### After (Secure)
```python
# Patched search - WITH USER FILTERING
user_filter = models.Filter(
    must=[
        models.FieldCondition(
            key="metadata.user_id",
            match=models.MatchValue(value=current_user_id)
        )
    ]
)

search_results = await self._client.query_points(
    collection_name=collection_name,
    query=query_vector,
    using=vector_name,
    limit=limit,
    filter=user_filter  # CRITICAL SECURITY FIX
)
```

## Installation Steps

### For New Installations
1. The patch is automatically applied during startup
2. New collections will have proper indexes

### For Existing Installations

#### Option 1: Keep Existing Data (if data is clean)
1. **CRITICAL**: Run the index migration script:
   ```bash
   cd local-backend
   python scripts/add_user_index_to_qdrant.py
   ```

2. Verify the fix:
   ```bash
   python scripts/add_user_index_to_qdrant.py --verify-only
   ```

#### Option 2: Clean Slate (if data integrity issues found)
If the verification shows documents without proper `user_id` metadata:

1. **Delete all existing documents and start fresh**:
   ```bash
   cd local-backend
   python scripts/add_user_index_to_qdrant.py --delete-all-documents
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: This will permanently delete all uploaded files!
   
2. The script will create proper indexes on the clean collection
3. Users will need to re-upload their documents with the new secure system

#### Verification Only
To check if your current data has integrity issues:
```bash
python scripts/add_user_index_to_qdrant.py --verify-only
```

## Verification

The patch can be verified by:

1. **Startup Logs**: Look for "‚úÖ Qdrant security patches applied successfully"
2. **Search Results**: Users should only see their own documents
3. **Data Integrity**: Run the verification script to check user_id presence

## Security Features

1. **Fail-Safe**: If user context cannot be determined, returns empty results instead of all documents
2. **Logging**: All security operations are logged for audit
3. **Index Optimization**: Adds proper indexes for efficient filtering
4. **Data Integrity Checks**: Verifies all documents have required metadata

## Important Notes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not modify** the original MCP Qdrant server source code (it's a submodule)
- ‚úÖ **The monkey patch** is applied at runtime during application startup
- üîí **Security is enforced** at the search level, preventing unauthorized access
- üìä **Performance impact** is minimal due to proper indexing

## Testing

To test the security fix:

1. Create documents with different user_ids
2. Perform searches as different users
3. Verify each user only sees their own documents
4. Check logs for security warnings

This fix ensures that Qdrant search operations are now secure and users can only access their own uploaded files.
